# Comparison Operators Practice  1:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool
num1 = 36
num2 = 17
if num1 >= num2:
    my_bool = print(True)
else:
    print(False)
# or could do this...
my_bool = (num1>=num2)
print(my_bool)


# Comparison Operators Practice  2:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):
# Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
# Inside num2, store the number 5.
# Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
from math import * 
num1 = sqrt(25)
num2 = 5
if num1 == num2:
    my_bool = print(True)
else:
    print(False)
# or
my_bool = num1 == num2 
print(my_bool)


# Comparison Operators Practice #3:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):

# Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3
num1 = 64 * 3
# Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8
num2 = 24 * 8
# Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
my_bool = num1 != num2
print(my_bool)


#######################comparison operators challenge#####################
# Challenge: Compare two numbers entered by the user and check if they are equal or not.
# If they are not equal, print which one is greater.

# Prompt the user for two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Check for equality and greater number
# if num1 == num2:

# num1 > num2:
#     print(num1 + ">" + num2)
# elif num2 > num1:
#     print(num2 + ">" + num1)
